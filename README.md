This project was created as the final to my Intro to Software Systems course, in which we build and manage a store. 
I have starred the original GitHub repository, as this final was collaborative and I do not own the original repo. 
This project shows extreme proficiency with Class relationships, GitHub collaboration, and I/O programming.
